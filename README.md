> Express middleware to handle openapi security.

## Highlights

* Easily handle security schemes.
* Performant.
* Extensively tested.
* Small footprint.
* Currently supports openapi 2.0 (f.k.a. swagger 2.0) security definitions.

## Example

See `./test/data-driven/*.js` for more examples.

```javascript
var app = require('express')();
var securityDefinitions = {
  keyScheme: {
    type: 'apiKey',
    name: 'api_key',
    in: 'header'
  },
  passwordScheme: {
    type: 'basic'
  }
};
var securityHandlers = {
  keyScheme: function(req, scopes, securityDefinition, cb) {
    req.user = {name: 'fred'};
    cb(null, true);// pass true if validation succeeds, false otherwise.
  },
  passwordScheme: function(req, scopes, securityDefinition, cb) {
    req.user = {name: 'fred'};
    cb(null, true);
  }
};
var operationSecurity = [
  // we'll execute all the schemes in the object.  If any fail, we'll move to the
  // next object.
  {
    keyScheme: ['write']
  },
  {
    passwordScheme: ['write']
  }
];
var security = require('express-openapi-security')(securityDefinition,
    securityHandlers, operationSecurity);

app.get('/something', security, function(req, res) {
  console.log(req.user.name); //=> 'fred'
});
```

## Response

`express-openapi-security` will respond in the following ways:

* `401`
  * This status code is sent if:
    * `cb(null, false)` is called from all `securityHandlers`.
    * `cb({status: 401, challange: 'a challenge string like "Basic"'})` is called
      from at least one of the handlers in the last set of security handlers.
* `403`
  * This status code is sent if:
    * `cb({status: 403, message: 'some message'})` is called
      from at least one of the handlers in the last set of security handlers.
* `500`
  * This status code is sent if:
    * An unknown `status` is passed to `cb`.
    * No security handlers yield `true`.

## Successful Authentication

Upon successful authentication, `next()` is called.
